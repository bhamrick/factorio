## Factorio Design Calculator

This is a tool for understanding the performance of a factory design in Factorio.
To use it, define a configuration of resources flowing between machines, and
then run with the filename as the sole argument. The program will print out
various data such as how many of each machine are needed, how much input is
needed to hit the target, and how much electricity the pipeline will consume.

Note that not all recipes are currently supported.

See the files in designs/ for examples of how to specify arrangements.
